All my hobby/consultation projects/learnings in ROS2.

<!-- ## Gantry Arm ROS2 simulation in Gazebo. -->

- [Gantry Arm simulation](gantry_painting_arm/README.md): 
    - My first consultation gig!

    - This project is a ROS2 Gazebo + Moveit2 implementation of car painting robot arm in a `gantry-like` setup. Click on link for further detailed description.

- **Development of ROS2 motor driver**
    - This project was undertaken for a stealth startup based in Slovenia, where we developed a ROS 2 motor driver utilizing CANOpen with the DS402 protocol. My contributions included designing and implementing a motor controller that facilitated teleoperation for their robot. In addition to this, we provided architectural guidance and assisted their engineers in initiating the implementation of Visual SLAM for robot navigation.

- [Pick and Place Robot Arm simulation](pick_place_arm/README.md): 
    - This project is a ROS2 Moveit2 implementation of robot arm used for palletization for boxes in a  `warehouse` setup. PRoject was done for a stealth startup in Belgium.Click on link for further detailed description.
